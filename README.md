# Oracle-of-Bacon
Project Description

The Oracle of Bacon project explores the connections in the film industry by analyzing how actors and movies are linked. It involves creating different graph structures—like Actor-Actor, Actor-Movie, and Movie-Movie—to map out the relationships between actors and the films they've appeared in. The project uses sets for efficient storage of actors and movies, and queues for implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find paths through these graphs. The goal is to calculate degrees of separation and the "Hollywood number," which measures an actor's central role in the network. Frequency charts are used to show how these connections are distributed, offering insights into the network's structure.


Skills and Technologies

This project demonstrates a solid grasp of computer science principles, including graph structures, BFS, and analyzing network statistics. Using sets helps manage unique actors and movies efficiently, while custom queues support effective BFS traversal. These techniques show an understanding of how to handle complex data relationships and extract useful information. The Oracle of Bacon isn't just about Hollywood connections—it’s also a chance to apply skills in graph theory and data analysis in a practical way.
